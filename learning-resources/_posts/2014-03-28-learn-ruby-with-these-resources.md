title: Learning resources for ruby
---

In this tutorial i'm gonna to show you some resources to learn ruby. Some are
paid, some are free, it depends on you what you choose.

So where to start? It depends on who you are.

## You have no programming background and you like reading books

### Learn to Program by Chris Pine

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Program-Second-Facets-Ruby/dp/1934356360/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1396001035&sr=1-1&keywords=learn+to+program"><img class="book" src="/images/learn-to-program.jpg"></img></a>

This book assumes you have no programming background. You will walk
through practical examples about how to write code in Ruby. You will start
with basic data types like variables, numbers, strings. Then you will move on
classes, reading, writting to the file, lambdas, procs. What I like about
this book is it's readability and interesting exercises.

### Begining Ruby from Novice To Professional

<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Ruby-Novice-Professional-Experts/dp/1430223634/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1396001263&sr=1-1&keywords=beginning+ruby+from+novice+to+professional"><img
class="book" src="/images/beginning-ruby.jpg"></img></a>

It's a standard book about how to learn ruby. It begins with baby steps in ruby
language, then you broad to advanced topics like how to distribute ruby gems,
how to use threads and sockets, how to use ruby in web development with Rails,
Sinatra, Ramaze and how to use ruby in **gui** apps. Only disadvantage of this
book is that it's really old. It was published in 2009, so it's very long time.

## You like challenges

So you want to know ruby language and don't have time to read book. Try this
online guide:

[Learn Ruby Hardway](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/) online book by Zed Shaw.

What I like about this book is that it moves you straight to action. You walk up through series of exercises. Every exercise contains **what you should see**
section. If your screen doesn't matches with book you should find error in your
code and try again.

## You want some online interactive tutorials

Try these tutorials:

* [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)

* [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/)

* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby)

* [Hackety Hack](http://hackety.com/)

## You have some programming background from other language

If you came from object oriented language like Java, Programming Ruby by
Pragmatic Bookshelf is definitely good place to start and you can use it for
reference along with ruby docs.

## What's next

You definitely use Ruby in your apps. If you are into gui development you can
start with [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/), or you can try web development with
**Rails** or Sinatra**
