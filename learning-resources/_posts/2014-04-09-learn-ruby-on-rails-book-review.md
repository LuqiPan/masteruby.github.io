title: Learn Ruby on Rails book review
---

Recently I received free copy of Learn Ruby on Rails book by Daniel Kehoe, so I've
decided to write this review.

<a href="http://learn-rails.com/"><img class="book"
src="/images/learn-rails-book-cover.jpg" alt="learn ruby on rails"></a>

## Who is this book for

Book is aimed at begining rails developers. So if you have no experiences
with Rails, that's first book you should try. You will find out all example
code on [github repository](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails) and because book is part of subscription program
you will get access to book updates, some other tutorials and another book
about Bootstrap.

## What's in this book

Book gives you step by step guide for creating rails application. In example application you will create mailing list with integration with MailChimp and Google Drive. It gives review of how developing applications in rails works.
You will find out introduction to git, you'll be explained to models, views
and controllers and you'll be introduced to some gems for easier development. 

## What I like about this book

What I like about this book is developer's approach to creating rails applications.
Maybe you'll be surprised that in first chapters you will read about things
like agile practices, creating github account, planning, managing your
application. That's interesting approach that I didn't find in any other
introductory rails book like Agile Web Development with Rails and Learn Web
Development with Ruby on Rails by Michael Hartl. 

I've also liked author's approach to learning about views, controllers. He doesn't use rails scaffold command, but he want from you to
build your controllers, models and views from scratch. That's a best way to
learning about it. Author encourages you to play with your code and try
something new.

Book is written in friendly plain language, so you don't have to worry about
that you don't understand. After writing some code author gives you brief
explanation what he've just done. 

What I've found useful is long gem list for easier development. You'll be
introduced to useful gems like **figaro**, **rails_layout** for easier web
development. 

## What I've been missing

What I've been missing is absence of test driven development, but as author
explains, this is a prequel book you should read before Michael Hartl Tutorial. If you want to have additional resources about test driven development I recommend you either
[Cucumber](http://www.amazon.com/The-Cucumber-Book-Behaviour-Driven-Development/dp/1934356808)
and
[Rspec](http://www.amazon.com/RSpec-Book-Behaviour-Development-Cucumber/dp/1934356379/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1397032931&sr=1-1&keywords=rspec) book, or online version of Michael Hartl book.

## Conclusion

So if you're absolutely new to Ruby on Rails development, Learn Rails Book is a
must read for you.
