---

In this post I want to give you list of books for rails beginner or
intermediate developer.

## For Beginner

### 1. [Learn Ruby on Rails](http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html) by Daniel Kehoe

<a href="http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html"><img src="/images/learn-rails-book-cover.jpg" class="book" alt="learn ruby on rails
book"></img></a>

Here's the first book you should read. This book will give you basic
introduction to
rails. In step by step guide you will learn how to create mailing list with
integration with MailChimp and GoogleDrive. I've included detailed review of
[learn ruby on rails book](/learning-resources/2014/04/09/learn-ruby-on-rails-book-review.html) right here.

### 2. [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Rails-Tutorial-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321832051/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1398328251&sr=1-1&keywords=ruby+on+rails+tutorial) by Michael Hartl

<a

src="/images/ruby_on_rails_tutorial.jpeg" class="book" alt="ruby on rails
tutorial"></img></a>

Ruby on Rails Tutorial is a must read for every rails beginner. I think you should
read this after learn ruby on rails book.

Are you bored with building example
applications like how to create blog in rails? So here's the step by step guide
to creating Twitter like social network.

Not only this book covers rails
perfectly, but it is perfect introduction to test driven development in rspec,
styling with sass and tracking changes in your code in git.



### 3. [Agile Web Development with Rails](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Development-Rails-Facets-Ruby/dp/1937785564/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1398328340&sr=1-1&keywords=agile+web+development+with+rails+4) by David Heinemeier Hansson, Dave Thomas

<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Development-Rails-Facets-Ruby/dp/1937785564/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1398328340&sr=1-1&keywords=agile+web+development+with+rails+4"><img src="/images/agile_web_development_with_rails.jpg" class="book" alt="agile web
development with rails"></img></a>

Here is the book written by two legendary figures in programming. David
Heinemeier Hannson, founder of 37 signals, creator of Ruby on Rails framework and
author of books like Getting Real, Rework and Remote and Dave Thomas author of
legendary book Pragmatic Programmer that every developer should read. In this
book you will learn how to create Depot, web based shopping cart application.



## For intermediate developer

### 4. [Rails Antipatterns](http://www.amazon.com/Rails-AntiPatterns-Refactoring-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321604814/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1398326493&sr=1-1&keywords=rails+antipatterns) by Chad Pytel and Tammer Saleh

<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-AntiPatterns-Refactoring-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321604814/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1398326493&sr=1-1&keywords=rails+antipatterns"><img
src="/images/rails_antipatterns.jpg" class="book" alt="rails
antipatterns"></img></a>

Are you getting headaches from your masses of code? Did you find your rails code unreadable, difficult to maintain?

Maybe you will find your rails antipattern. Here's the problem and solution guide to your problems.

What I like about this book that takes every part of Rails application separately. You
will look at problems like too much code in models, using sql code where it
don't belong, bad habits brought from php and else.


### 5. [The Rails View](http://www.amazon.com/The-Rails-View-Maintainable-Experience/dp/1934356875) by Bruce Williams and Bruce Athayde

<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-View-Beautiful-Maintainable-Experience/dp/1934356875/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1398343196&sr=1-1&keywords=the+rails+view"><img
src="/images/rails_view.jpg" class="book" alt="rails view"></img></a>

Are you getting sick from combination of html and your template language in
your views? Are you hoping that your views code should look better, but don't know how? 

Try Rails View book, in this book you will look at each part of
views, you will find out solutions about how to improve your layout, you will
learn some tricks about how to improve your stylesheets, adding some beauty to
your forms, better javascripts code and other.

### 6. [Deploying Rails](http://example.com) by Anthony Burns and Tom Copeland

<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Deploying-Rails-Automate-Deploy-Maintain/dp/1934356956"><img
src="/images/deploying_rails.jpg" class="book" alt="deploying rails"></img></a>

Are you developing real world rails application and you wonder how to deploy it?
Deploying Rails book is here for you.

In first part of the book you will learn
how to create your own virtual server with Vagrant, then you move on open
source server provision tool Puppet. Then you will be introduced to gems like
Capistrano, Nagios for better deployment.

## What's next

If you're beginner I recommend you to learn ruby first, I've wrote post about [learning resources
for ruby](/learning-resources/2014/03/28/learn-ruby-with-these-resources.html) and if you have trouble with rails
installation I wrote about [how to install rails](/learning-resources) in my
previous post. I hope that my list of books about Rails was helpful for you.
